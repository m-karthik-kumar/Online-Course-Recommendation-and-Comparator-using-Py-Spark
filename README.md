# Course-Recommendation
     Demand and need for virtual education are increasing day by day due to the convenience it provides. Many companies encase this demand. Thus, multiple platforms provide similar courses. It is difficult for a user to choose the appropriate course from a huge number of courses available on multiple platforms. Personalized course recommendation technology is one of the hotspots in the online education field. Recommendation technologies that would compare different learning platforms are rare. Choose which course is best and which platform to choose is a tedious job and is difficult for a user to do manually. The aim of the project is to provide a convenient platform that addresses this issue. A good recommendation algorithm can stimulate learner’s enthusiasm. However, a recommendation system that not just recommends but also compares to help the user is better. A large amount of data about these courses such as ratings, price, reviews, comments, number of enrollments, etc. is used to make the correct decision while comparing. The project provides a platform in which a user can search for the best courses in the domain of their choice and compare any two similar courses from different platforms in detail. The user will also receive recommendations for similar courses.
